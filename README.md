# herc_nlp
Tutorials and other code developed for the HERC NLP group

## Getting Started
There are three options for running the tutorial:

### 1. Binder
The most straightforward way is to use a tool called binder. It will open up an online file directory that will let you access the interactive tutorial directly. All of the requisite software and dependencies will be automatically set up.

Once it loads the directory, click on the file **`herc_nlp_tutorial.ipynb`**, which should open up in a new tab.

However, if you leave the server inactive or idle for too long, it may shut down automatically and you will lose your progress. Restart it by reopening the link from this page.

### 2. Git Repository
If you are familiar with Git, you can set up this repository on your local machine and access all of the tutorial files that way. If you are unfamiliar and want to try it out, here is a [handy tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-started-with-git-and-github-6fcd0f2d4ac6)

You will have to ensure that you have the required software to run the tutorial. See the requirements section below.

### 3. Download Locally.

## Requirements
Running the file herc_nlp_tutorial.ipynb requires
1. Python 3
2. pandas module and all dependencies
3. Jupyter Notebook

The easiest way to get started is to download the Anaconda distribution (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) and follow the download/install instructions.

Afterwards, using your command line, enter <code>jupyter notebook</code> in the root directory of this repository. Once the directory loads in the browser, open the file 'herc_nlp_tutorial.ipynb' and follow the instructions to go through the tutorial.
