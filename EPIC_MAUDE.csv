2854922,97547," /// (B)(6). DATE RECEIVED: (B)(4) 2012. ACTUAL ERROR: YES. DESCRIPTION: SITUATION: A FENTANYL INFUSION WAS ORDERED USING EPIC SOFTWARE FOR A (B)(6) PT AT A RATE OF 2 MCG/KG/HR, FOR A TOTAL OF 30 MCG/HR. THE ALARIS PUMP USED TO ADMINISTER THE INFUSION DID NOT HAVE AN OPTION TO SELECT 30 MCG/HR. THE PUMP WAS THEN INADVERTENTLY PROGRAMMED TO ADMINISTER 30 MCG/KG/HR. BACKGROUND: FENTANYL IS A STRONG AGONIST AT MU-OPIOID RECEPTORS, WITH A RELATIVELY RAPID ONSET AND SHORT DURATION OF ACTION. INTRAVENOUS FENTANYL IS COMMONLY USED FOR ANALGESIA AND FOR ANESTHESIA, OFTEN IN COMBINATION WITH A BENZODIAZEPINE. AS A POTENT OPIOID AGONIST, ITS SIDE EFFECTS CAN BE POTENTIALLY FATAL, ESPECIALLY IF ADMINISTERED AT HIGH, INAPPROPRIATE DOSES. IN PARTICULAR, THESE SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE SOMNOLENCE, RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION, SEIZURES, AND COMA. CONTINUOUS SEDATION OR ANALGESIA WITH FENTANYL FOR PEDIATRIC PATIENT IS RECOMMENDED WITH AN INITIAL IV BOLUS OF 1-2 MCG/KG AND THEN 1 MCG/KG/HR. TITRATION TO DESIRED EFFECT IS APPROPRIATE WITH USUAL DOSING AT 1-3 MCG/KG/HR, THOUGH SOME PTS REQUIRE 5 MCG/KG/HR. ASSESSMENT: A MEDICATION ERROR OCCURRED IN OUR HOSPITAL AND WAS RECORDED AS A NEAR MISS MEDICATION EVENT IN OUR VOLUNTARY ONLINE REPORTING SYSTEM, QUANTROS. THIS ERROR COULD HAVE RESULTED IN A PEDIATRIC PT RECEIVING AN OVERDOSE OF MEDICATION (FENTANYL INFUSION), POTENTIALLY RESULTING IN SEVERE HARM HAD THE ERROR NOT BEEN DISCOVERED PRIOR TO ADMINISTRATION. THE MEDICATION SAFETY OFFICER BECAME AWARE OF THE SITUATION AFTER REVIEWING QUANTROS REPORTS AND FURTHER EVALUATED THE OPTIONS FOR ORDERING PEDIATRIC INFUSION IN THE EPIC SYSTEM. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE UNITS AVAILABLE TO SELECT WHEN ORDERING A MEDICATION DID NOT MATCH THE UNITS AVAILABLE TO SELECT FOR ADMINISTRATION OF THE MEDICATION VIA ALARIS PUMPS FOR ALL PEDIATRIC INFUSIONS. AT THE TIME OF THE ERROR, PROVIDERS COULD NOT APPROPRIATELY ORDER FENTANYL INFUSIONS (AND CERTAIN OTHER MEDICATIONS) FOR PEDIATRICS. THESE INFUSIONS COULD ONLY BE ORDERED IN MCG/HR OR ML/HR, HOWEVER, THEY SHOULD BE ORDERED IN MCG/KG/HR (PER THE JOINT COMMISSION AND TO COMPLY WITH GUARDRAILS ON ALARIS PUMPS). ALARIS PUMPS USED TO ADMINISTER THESE INFUSION TO PTS ARE PROGRAMMED WITH THE UNITS, MCG/KG/HR. IN THIS SITUATION, THE UNITS FOR FENTANYL DID NOT CORRESPOND BETWEEN THE ALARIS PUMP AND THE EPIC SYSTEM, SO THE PUMP WOULD NOT ALLOW THE DOSE TO BE SELECTED AS ORDERED IN EPIC. SINCE THE DOSE OF 30 MCG/HR WAS NOT A PROGRAMMABLE OPTION, THE PUMP WAS INADVERTENTLY PROGRAMMED FOR 30 MCG/KG/HR. THE PT RECEIVED A BOLUS THAT WAS WITHIN NORMAL RANGE AND THE ERROR WAS DISCOVERED PRIOR TO ADMINISTERING THE INCORRECT INFUSION, THEREFORE, THE PT WAS NOT HARMED. RECOMMENDATION: UNITS SHOULD CORRESPOND BETWEEN THE EPIC SYSTEM AND ALARIS PUMPS TO PREVENT POTENTIAL MEDICATION ERRORS FROM OCCURRING. WITHOUT MATCHING UNITS, NURSES HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF CONVERTING THE DOSES TO APPROPRIATE UNITS, WHICH CAN RESULT IN A DELAY OF MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION AND A MEDICATION ERROR DUE TO MISCALCULATION, OR INAPPROPRIATE DOSING UNITS MAY BE SELECTED, WHICH COULD CAUSE SERIOUS HARM TO PTS. THE UNITS DISPLAYED ON ALARIS PUMPS CANNOT BE ALTERED, SO THE EPIC SYSTEM REQUIRES MODIFICATION. THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO SELECT UNITS FOR MEDICATIONS SHOULD BE MODIFIED IN THE EPIC SYSTEM SO THAT THEY MATCH THE ALARIS PUMPS. THESE UNITS SHOULD BE ADDED AS AN OPTION AS A DROP-DOWN BOX FROM THE MAGNIFYING GLASS ICON. HIGHLIGHTING THE UNITS AVAILABLE ON THE ALARIS PUMPS IN EPIC MAY ALSO HELP MAKE PRESCRIBERS AWARE THAT THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT CORRESPOND TO THE PUMPS.

IF ANY MEDICATION IS MISSED AND THIS SITUATION SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED. THE PHARMACY SHOULD BE EQUIPPED WITH TOOLS AND CONVERSION CHARTS TO ASSIST WITH UNIT AND DOSE CONVERSIONS THAT MAY BE COMMONLY USED. WHENEVER THIS PROCEDURE OCCURS, A BRIEF EXPLANATION OF THE STEPS TAKEN TO ENSURE CORRECT DOSAGE ADMINISTRATION SHOULD BE DOCUMENTED. THESE INDIVIDUAL CASES SHOULD BE REPORTED TO THE MEDICATION SAFETY OFFICER WHO SHOULD F/U WITH THE MAKING ADD'L CHANGES IN THE EPIC SYSTEM AS NECESSARY. MEDICATION ADMINISTERED TO OR USED BY THE PT: NO. OUTCOME: THE PT WAS NOT HARMED. WHEN AND HOW WAS ERROR DISCOVERED: THE PT RECEIVED A BOLUS THAT WAS WITHIN RANGE AND THE ERROR WAS DISCOVERED PRIOR TO ADMINISTERING THE INCORRECT INFUSION, THEREFORE, THE PT WAS NOT HARMED. PT COUNSELING PROVIDED: UNK. REPORTER'S RECOMMENDATION: UNITS SHOULD CORRESPOND BETWEEN THE EPIC SYSTEM AND ALARIS PUMPS TO PREVENT POTENTIAL MEDICATION ERRORS FROM OCCURRING. WITHOUT MATCHING UNITS, NURSES HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF CONVERTING THE DOSES TO APPROPRIATE UNITS, WHICH CAN RESULT IN A DELAY OF MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION AND A MEDICATION ERROR DUE TO MISCALCULATION, OR INAPPROPRIATE DOSING UNITS MAY BE SELECTED, WHICH COULD CAUSE SERIOUS HARM TO PTS.

WE ARE DAYS AWAY FROM GOING LIVE WITH AN ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD, EPIC. DURING TRAINING/PREPARATION I HAD THE FOLLOWING REALIZATION: THE UNITS LISTED AS THE """"ADMIN AMOUNT"""" ON THE MAR DO NOT MATCH THE UNITS USED TO PROGRAM THE SMART IV INFUSION PUMP ON SEVERAL HIGH ALERT MEDS. (I ALSO DO THE DRUG LIBRARY PUMP PROGRAMMING). THE MAR DISPLAYS AN """"ORDERED DOSE"""", """"ADMIN AMOUNT""""; AND """"ORDERED INFUSION RATE"""". THE LIBRARY HAS BEEN SET UP TO MATCH THE UNITS MEDICATIONS ARE ORDERED IN, SO THE EXTRANEOUS INFO IS NOT NEEDED TO PROGRAM THE PUMP AND INTRODUCES THE POSSIBILITY OF ERROR OR COULD DISCOURAGE USE OF THE DRUG LIBRARY. I CREATED A COUPLE OF DOCUMENTS WITH EXAMPLES AND EXPLANATIONS. I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE AND HAS NOT CAUSED ANY PROBLEMS IN OTHER SSM HOSPITALS ALREADY ON EPIC. IT IS TRUE THAT LIMITS IN THE PUMP OR ALERTS DOCUMENTING ADMINISTRATION WILL PREVENT THIS SOME OF THE TIME, BUT THERE ARE CASES WHERE THE ERROR COULD GET BY WITH OUT AN ALERT AT ALL. ALSO I AM NOT SURE ABOUT RELYING ON ALERTS (MANY OF WHICH CAN BE OVERRIDDEN) TO PREVENT THE ERROR WHEN THE REAL PROBLEM IS HAVING THIS EXTRA INFO ON THE (B)(6). AFTER FINDING AN ACTUAL ERROR WHERE THIS HAPPENED, I WAS ABLE TO GET 2 CUSTOM ENTRIES FOR MY HOSPITALS WHICH WILL NOT DISPLAY THE """"ADMIN AMOUNT"""" EPINEPHRINE AND NOREPINEPHRINE BECAUSE OUR PUMPS ARE IN MCG/KG/MIN AND THE ADMIN AMOUNT IS IN MCG/MIN. PLEASE REVIEW AND PROVIDE YOUR OPINION. THE ATTACHED DOCUMENTS EXPLAIN IN MORE DETAIL. ANALYSIS - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF POTENTIAL FAILURE MODES: THE """"ADMIN AMOUNT"""" AND """"ORDERED INFUSION RATE"""" ARE NOT NECESSARY TO PROGRAM THE INFUSION PUMP. THE PUMP UNITS ARE SET TO THE """"PRESCRIBED DOSE."""" THE UNNEEDED/EXTRANEOUS INFO COULD CREATE CONFUSION AND INTRODUCE THE POSSIBILITY OF ERROR. THIS PROCESS IS NOT ERROR PROOFED TO THE DEGREE POTENTIALLY POSSIBLE. THE LIKELIHOOD AND SEVERITY OF ERROR REACHING THE PT IS DEPENDENT ON SEVERAL FACTORS: MEDICATION INVOLVED, UNITS SET UP IN THE PUMP BY THE DRUG LIBRARY AT EACH SSM HOSP, UNITS THAT APPEAR IN THE """"ADMIN AMOUNT"""" (MG/MIN OR MCG/MIN IN EXAMPLES ABOVE), NORMAL DOSING RANGE ON INDIVIDUAL MEDICATIONS, WHETHER THE OVERLAP IN NUMERIC VALUES IN DIFFERENT UNITS OCCURS AT INITIATION RATES OR UPPER DOSING RANGES, CONCENTRATION OF INDIVIDUAL MEDICATIONS AND LIMITS ON INDIVIDUAL MEDICATION SET IN THE DRUG LIBRARY AT EACH SSM HOSP. DISPLAYING THE INFUSION RATE (ML/HOUR) COULD DISCOURAGE USE OF THE DRUG LIBRARY AND BYPASS IMPORTANT SAFE GUARDS. IN THE CASE OF A PHYSICIAN ORDERING MEDICATIONS AT THE BEDSIDE (WHERE MAR MAY NOT BE CONSULTED) THE UNITS IN THE DRUG LIBRARY SHOULD BE THE SAME AS THE UNITS MEDICATIONS ARE ORDERED IN.

ON AN UNKNOWN DATE IN 2012, A MITRAL VALVE REPLACEMENT (MVR), TRICUSPID ANNULOPLASTY (TAP) AND MAZE PROCEDURE WERE PERFORMED. THIS 31MM EPIC VALVE WAS IMPLANTED IN THE PATIENT'S MITRAL POSITION AND A 34MM EDWARDS MC3 TRICUSPID ANNULOPLASTY RING IN THE TRICUSPID POSITION. IN THE BEGINNING OF (B)(6) 2014, THE PATIENT EXPERIENCED GENERAL FATIGUE AND LOSS OF APPETITE. LATER, THE PATIENT PRESENTED AT THE HOSPITAL WITH A HIGH FEVER OF 39.0 DEGREES CELSIUS. A CHEST RADIOGRAPHY REVEALED CARDIOTHORACIC RATIO (CTR) OF 60 PERCENT, BILATERAL PLEURAL EFFUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANT PULMONARY CONGESTION. CANDIDA GRABLATA WAS DETECTED BY BLOOD CULTURE. A TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY (TTE) WAS PERFORMED AND LARGE VEGETATIONS WERE ATTACHED TO BOTH ANTERIOR AND POSTERIOR LEAFLETS ON MULTIPLE SITES OF THE 31MM EPIC VALVE, WHICH WERE FLOATING AND HAD A MAXIMUM DIAMETER OF 20 MM. THE PATIENT'S CARDIAC FUNCTION WAS NORMAL AT THIS TIME; HOWEVER, MITRAL REGURGITATION (MR) WAS CONFIRMED. DUE TO THE HIGH POSSIBILITY OF LEAFLET PROLAPSE AND PROSTHETIC VALVE ENDOCARDITIS (PVE) DUE TO FUNGAL INFECTION AN EMERGENCY SURGERY WAS PERFORMED. UPON EXPLANT OF THE 31MM EPIC VALVE, LARGE AND MULTIPLE VEGETATIONS WERE ADHERED ON THE VALVE AND THE LEAFLETS HAD BECOME DISRUPTED AND MOSTLY PROLAPSED. NO ABSCESS WAS OBSERVED ON THE PATIENT'S NATIVE MITRAL ANNULUS. A 31MM CARBOMEDICS VALVE (SORIN) WAS IMPLANTED WITHIN THE MITRAL POSITION.

CILOSTAZOL HAS AN EFFECT ON HEART RATE REDUCTION; AS CORONARY BLOOD FLOW COULD BE MAINTAINED BY INCREASING CYCLIC ADENOSINE MONOPHOSPHATE (CAMP) WITHIN CARDIOMYOCYTE, BLOOD FLOW TO SINUS NODE AND ATRIOVENTRICULAR NODE INCREASED AS WELL.

5568285,5145769," /// ARTICLE - A PROSPECTIVE, RANDOMIZED COMPARISON OF 3 CONTEMPORARY BIOPROSTHETIC AORTIC VALVES: SHOULD HEMODYNAMIC PERFORMANCE INFLUENCE DEVICE SELECTION? ABSTRACT - OBJECTIVE: LATEST GENERATION BIOLOGIC AORTIC VALVE PROSTHESES WERE DESIGNED TO IMPROVE HEMODYNAMIC PERFORMANCE. WE SOUGHT TO DETERMINE WHETHER THERE ARE CLINICALLY IMPORTANT EARLY DIFFERENCES AMONG THESE DEVICES. METHODS: THREE HUNDRED ADULTS WITH SEVERE AORTIC VALVE STENOSIS UNDERGOING AORTIC VALVE REPLACEMENT WERE RANDOMIZED TO RECEIVE THE EDWARDS MAGNA, SORIN MITROFLOW, OR ST. JUDE EPIC BIOPROSTHESES (N = 100, N = 101, N = 99, RESPECTIVELY). EARLY HEMODYNAMIC PERFORMANCE WAS STUDIED BY ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY. RESULTS: MEAN PATIENT AGE WAS 76 +/- 8 YEARS AND THERE WERE 203 MEN (68%). THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS AMONG IMPLANT GROUPS. EARLY MORTALITY WAS 1.7%, AND THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES IN EARLY ADVERSE EVENTS. POSTOPERATIVE ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY SHOWED SMALL BUT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES OVERALL BETWEEN THE MAGNA, MITROFLOW, AND EPIC VALVES IN MEAN GRADIENT (14.2 MM HG, 16.3 MM HG, 16.5 MM HG, RESPECTIVELY; P = .011), AORTIC VALVE AREA (2.05 CM2, 1.88 CM2, 1.86 CM2, RESPECTIVELY; P = .012), AND INDEXED AORTIC VALVE AREA (1.05 CM2/M2, 0.97 CM2/M2, 0.95 CM2/M2, RESPECTIVELY; P = .012). PROSTHETIC PERFORMANCE WAS SIMILAR AMONG ALL WITH A SMALL (LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 21 MM) AORTIC ANNULUS. PATIENTS WHO RECEIVED THE MAGNA DEVICE WITH A 23-MM ANNULUS HAD SLIGHTLY GREATER INDEXED AORTIC VALVE AREA; THOSE WITH >23 MM HAD A SLIGHTLY LOWER TRANSPROSTHETIC GRADIENT. ANALOGOUS TRENDS WERE FOUND WHEN DATA WERE STRATIFIED BY EITHER COMMERCIAL IMPLANT SIZE OR ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY-DETERMINED AORTIC ANNULUS SIZE. SEVERE PATIENTÂ¿PROSTHESIS MISMATCH WAS INFREQUENT OVERALL AND WAS SIMILARLY LOW AMONG DEVICES (P VALUE NOT SIGNIFICANT). CONCLUSIONS: THIS PROSPECTIVE, RANDOMIZED COMPARISON REVEALS THAT THERE ARE SMALL BUT CONSISTENT EARLY POSTOPERATIVE HEMODYNAMIC DIFFERENCES AMONG CURRENT THIRD-GENERATION PORCINE AND PERICARDIAL AORTIC VALVE PROSTHESES. THE 3 VALVES STUDIED PERFORMED EQUALLY WELL IN PATIENTS WITH A SMALL (LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 21 MM) AORTIC ANNULUS. THE MAGNA VALVE HAD A SLIGHTLY LOWER MEAN GRADIENT IN THOSE WITH LARGER ANNULAR SIZE (>23 MM). LONGITUDINAL FOLLOW-UP OF THESE RANDOMIZED COHORTS IS ESSENTIAL TO DETERMINE LATE CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THESE EARLY POSTOPERATIVE FINDINGS. SUMMARY Â¿ THROUGH WRITTEN ARTICLE, EDWARDS RECEIVED INFORMATION THAT SIX (6) PATIENTS EXHIBITED SEVERE PATIENT PROSTHESIS MISMATCH (PPM). NO ADDITIONAL DETAILS WERE PROVIDED."

IN ALL, 980 LIMBS TREATED WITH PERCUTANEOUS TRANSLUMINAL ANGIOPLASTY_STENTING OF THE FEMORO-POPLITEAL SEGMENT BETWEEN 2005 AND 2012 WERE REVIEWED. SEVENTY-SIX PATIENTS REPRESENTING 83 LIMBS WITH DE NOVO TRANSATLANTIC INTER-SOCIETY CONSENSUS C AND D LESIONS MEASURING _15 CM CONTINUOUSLY WERE IDENTIFIED (MEAN AGE 71.3_12.1 YEARS, 62% MALE). RESULTS: TWENTY-FIVE (30.1%) LIMBS WERE TREATED FOR SEVERE CLAUDICATION AND 58 (69.9%) FOR CRITICAL LIMB ISCHEMIA. THE MEAN PRE-PROCEDURAL ANKLE-BRACHIAL INDEX WAS 0.47_0.19. THE MEAN LESION LENGTH WAS 22.9_4.82 CM. SEVENTY PATIENTS REPRESENTING 77 LIMBS WERE AVAILABLE FOR A MEAN FOLLOW-UP LENGTH OF 19.5 MONTHS (RANGE 0Â¿79).

OF THE 67 REQUIRED ADJUNCTIVE INTERVENTIONS, ONLY FOUR (6.0%) STENOSES/OCCLUSIONS NOTED IN INFRAPOPLITEAL VESSELS WERE UNABLE TO BE TRAVERSED. THREE (4.5%) PATIENTS REQUIRED ADJUNCTIVE ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT DUE TO DISTAL EMBOLI NOTED FOLLOWING FPA ANGIOPLASTY. ELEVEN OF 25 (44.0%) LIMBS WITH CLAUDICATION REQUIRED ADJUNCTIVE INTERVENTION COMPARED TO 32 OF 57 (56.1%) LIMBS WITH CLI.

IN ALL, 980 LIMBS TREATED WITH PERCUTANEOUS TRANSLUMINAL ANGIOPLASTY_STENTING OF THE FEMORO-POPLITEAL SEGMENT BETWEEN 2005 AND 2012 WERE REVIEWED. SEVENTY-SIX PATIENTS REPRESENTING 83 LIMBS WITH DE NOVO TRANSATLANTIC INTER-SOCIETY CONSENSUS C AND D LESIONS MEASURING _15 CM CONTINUOUSLY WERE IDENTIFIED (MEAN AGE 71.3_12.1 YEARS, 62% MALE). RESULTS: TWENTY-FIVE (30.1%) LIMBS WERE TREATED FOR SEVERE CLAUDICATION AND 58 (69.9%) FOR CRITICAL LIMB ISCHEMIA. THE MEAN PRE-PROCEDURAL ANKLE-BRACHIAL INDEX WAS 0.47_0.19. THE MEAN LESION LENGTH WAS 22.9_4.82 CM. SEVENTY PATIENTS REPRESENTING 77 LIMBS WERE AVAILABLE FOR A MEAN FOLLOW-UP LENGTH OF 19.5 MONTHS (RANGE 0Â¿79). THE MEAN POST-PROCEDURAL ANKLE-BRACHIAL INDEX WAS 0.71_0.28. PRIMARY, ASSISTED-PRIMARY, AND SECONDARY PATENCY RATES WERE 68.1%, 72.7%, AND 83.3% AT 6 MONTHS, 55.3%, 63.6%, AND 58.3% AT 12 MONTHS, AND 38.2%, UNAVAILABLE, AND 10.4% AT 24 MONTHS, RESPECTIVELY.

(AVAILABLE ONLY IN JAPANESE) TITLE: SURGICAL INTERVENTION FOR MITRAL VALVE LESION ASSOCIATED WITH SEVERE MITRAL ANNULAR CALCIFICATION. THIS STUDY WAS CONSISTING OF 11 PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT THE SURGICAL INTERVENTION FOR MITRAL VALVE DISEASE ASSOCIATED WITH SEVERE MITRAL ANNULAR CALCIFICATION (MAC) BETWEEN 2011 AND JUNE OF 2017. THE SURGICAL INTERVENTION WAS PERFORMED WITH 4 PROCEDURE METHODS AS FOLLOW: PROCEDURE METHOD A WAS THAT MITRAL VALVULOPLASTY (MVP) WAS PERFORMED FOR THE TREATMENT OF MITRAL REGURGITATION (MR) WITH NO MORE THAN MODERATE GRADE OF MITRAL STENOSIS (MS). NO TREATMENT WAS CONDUCTED FOR MAC. PROCEDURE METHOD B WAS THAT MITRAL VALVE REPLACEMENT (MVR) WAS PERFORMED FOR THE TREATMENT OF MS. PRIOR TO MVR, LEAFLETS OF PATIENT'S NATIVE VALVE IN THE MITRAL POSITION AND LEFT ATRIAL WALL WERE SUTURED IN ORDER TO NEWLY FORM THE ANNULUS INSIDE OF MAC. PROCEDURE METHOD C WAS THAT MVR WAS PERFORMED AFTER REMOVAL AND DECALCIFICATION OF THE CALCIFIED ANNULUS IF NECESSARY (IT DEPENDS ON THE PHYSICIAN'S DECISION). PROCEDURE METHOD D WAS THAT MVR WAS PERFORMED AFTER CONDUCTING MVP WITH HETEROGENEOUS PERICARDIUM. PRIOR TO MVP, THE CALCIFIED ANNULUS WAS ENTIRELY REMOVED, THEN CARDIAC MUSCLE OF LEFT VENTRICLE AND LEFT ATRIAL WALL WERE SUTURED. THE PATIENTS UNDERWENT SURGICAL INTERVENTION WITH PROCEDURE METHOD A AND B IN TWO CASES RESPECTIVELY, PROCEDURE METHOD C IN FOUR CASES AND PROCEDURE METHOD D IN THREE CASES. ALTHOUGH NO LETHAL COMPLICATIONS WERE REPORTED, THERE WAS SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT IN THREE CASES WHERE ABBOTT PROSTHETIC VALVES WERE IMPLANTED. THERE WAS ONE EVENT REPORTED IN PROCEDURE METHOD D INVOLVING A SJM VALVE. ON AN UNKNOWN DATE, A MITRAL VALVE REPLACEMENT (MVR) WAS PERFORMED. INITIALLY MAC WAS ENTIRELY INCISED AND THE CARDIAC MUSCLE OF THE LEFT VENTRICLE AND LEFT ATRIAL WALL WERE SUTURED. AFTER THE ANNULUS WAS FORMED USING HETEROGENEOUS PERICARDIUM, THE MVR WAS PERFORMED AND THIS EPIC VALVE (MODEL AND SERIAL UNKNOWN) WAS IMPLANTED IN THE PATIENT'S MITRAL POSITION. THE PROCEDURE WAS COMPLETED WITH NO ISSUES. POSTOPERATIVELY, A LEFT VENTRICULAR ANEURYSM WAS OBSERVED. ON THE 14TH POSTOPERATIVE DAY, A REPEATED SURGERY WAS PERFORMED AND AT SURGERY, THE ANEURYSM WAS IDENTIFIED BENEATH THE ANNULUS ON THE POSTEROMEDIAL COMMISSURE SIDE OF THE MITRAL VALVE.
